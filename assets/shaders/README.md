# Shader Assets

This folder can contain custom OBS effect files (.effect) for advanced blur effects.

## Optional Files

If you have experience with OBS shaders, you can add:

1. **zoom_blur.effect** - Radial zoom blur effect
2. **motion_blur.effect** - Directional motion blur effect

## Notes

- These are OPTIONAL - the script will work without them
- The script automatically detects and uses the Composite Blur plugin if available
- Custom shaders are an advanced feature for users who want more control

## OBS Effect Format

For more information on OBS effect files, see the OBS Studio documentation.
